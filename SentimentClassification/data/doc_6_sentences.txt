President Trump's personality may pose a risk to the economy  according to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.
So reports MarketWatch.
Speaking at Morningstar's investment conference  Fink said  Trump's economic policies represent a "bucket list of things we'd like to see done."
But he added that the president is also the cause of market uncertainty and a threat to industries and growth engines.
"There are many who believe the U.S. is less welcoming" under Trump  said Fink.
"Hotels are seeing bookings down dramatically.
Universities are seeing a drop in applications from foreign students.
There's something that is slowing everything down."
Fink implied that this could be directly related to Trump  who has often struck a hostile tone towards other countries  including allies  as well as such groups as immigrants and refugees.
"You can't take personality out of the debate " Fink said.
"Politics is about personality."
Fink  who helps oversee more than $5 trillion in assets as BlackRock's chairman  also expressed concern over Trump's views on immigration.
"One of our main engines of growth over the past 50 years has been immigration " he said.
"If we reduce that or make it more difficult  then we won't have one of our major engines."
Fink pointed to first-quarter GDP of 0.7%  the weakest reading in three years.
"We're the slowest-growing economy in the [Group of 7] " he said.
"We're slower than France  which is really terrible."
