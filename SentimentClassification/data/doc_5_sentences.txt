By Tim Hanrahan     President Donald Trump  in expressing his admiration for President Andrew Jackson  questioned why America's Civil War wasn't avoided and painted the seventh president as a leader who could have stopped the war from breaking out.
In an excerpt of interview with Salena Zito of the Washington Examiner that was posted by Sirius XM  Mr. Trump said that if Jackson had "been a little later  you wouldn't have had the Civil War."
President Jackson served from 1829 to 1837  and died in 1845.
Mr. Trump has embraced comparisons of his own upstart campaign to Jackson's  and has a portrait of Jackson in the Oval Office.
"He was really angry  that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War " Mr. Trump said of Jackson. "
He said 'there's no reason for this.'
People don't realize the Civil War  you think about it.
Why.
People don't ask that question.
But why was there the civil War.
Why could that one not have been worked out?"
"Had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later  you wouldn't have had the Civil War" @realDonaldTrump told @SalenaZito.

Mr. Trump has often employed a loose style when talking about historical figures.
Earlier this year  he cited abolitionist Frederick Douglass as "an example of somebody who's done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more " which some heard as implying that Douglas  who died more than a hundred years ago  was still alive.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer clarified at the time that Mr. Trump intended to highlight the contributions that Douglas made.
