09:50 ET - Its $220M debt payment Friday was just a drop in the bucket for Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX)  which faces more than $28B in debt from a dealmaking binge under the previous chief executive.
Yet current CEO Joseph Papa tells  that the unscheduled debt payment  announced today  is a positive sign of the progress the company is making in reversing fortunes.
VRX has just $500M in debt due before 2020  Papa says  giving the company room to make business investments that could help drive growth.

With nearly two-thirds of firms having reported results  68% have beaten analysts' estimates on EPS and 63% have beaten estimates on sales  higher than the historical average beat rate of 53% for EPS and 56% on sales  according to BofA.

09:43 ET - Bank of America Merrill Lynch calls President Trump's approval of Keystone and Dakota-Access pipelines "just a warm up" as he begins unleashing the energy sector.
"Energy is a policy cornerstone  together with tax reform  in this administration."
As Trump targets job creation and economic growth  the investment bank says "for the energy sector  this means more access to Federal land and water resources and less regulation.
It means a faster build out of infrastructure."
Still  it also notes politics has something to do with all of this.
"Energy is a key focus because it creates jobs in red states and can respond to policy on time for next year's mid-term election."
