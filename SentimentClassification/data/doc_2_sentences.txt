09:43 ET - Bank of America Merrill Lynch calls President Trump's approval of Keystone and Dakota-Access pipelines "just a warm up" as he begins unleashing the energy sector.
"Energy is a policy cornerstone  together with tax reform  in this administration."
As Trump targets job creation and economic growth  the investment bank says "for the energy sector  this means more access to Federal land and water resources and less regulation.
It means a faster build out of infrastructure."
Still  it also notes politics has something to do with all of this.
"Energy is a key focus because it creates jobs in red states and can respond to policy on time for next year's mid-term election."
