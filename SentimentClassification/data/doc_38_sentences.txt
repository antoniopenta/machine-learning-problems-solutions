It was a shock to everyone when President Donald Trump abruptly fired F.B.I director James Comey -- even to Comey himself  who was speaking to Los Angeles bureau employees when television screens in the background alerted him of the news.
The NYTimes reported that Comey laughed at first.
He thought it was a prank.
It was no joke.
Now Washington D.C. is spinning out with lawmakers calling for a special counsel to take over Comey's investigation into Russian election meddling  Twitter is lit with     To be sure  all the usual suspects are up  but not by a lot.
The SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD) has gained 0.19% and  United States Oil ( USO) has gained 2.8%.
The big question is: should investors worry about political risk?
Following the election  many predicted that politics was likely to drive the market and market volatility.
Indexes have been built to follow Trump stocks  algorithms have been built to alert investors when Trump tweets about a stock they own  and headlines all point to "uncertainty" as the big negative.
Yet the VIX hit a 23-year low on Monday.
And the market has continued to march along  despite the noise.
It was reasonable for market commentators to discuss implications of unknowns.
Today  however  it has become apparent to this blogger that the discussion and agreement of the impact a certain event will have actually voids the event itself.
The markets are always pricing in possible future impact  so that by the time the discussions are over and something actually happens  no one cares anymore.
If political risk mattered so much then the volatility should be up with the big "I" for impeachment being discussed again  but the  ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ( VIXY) has fallen 0.26%.
The iPath S&P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN ( VXX) has fallen 0.18%.
How many more unknown unknowns will it take to cause a real panic?
