BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union beat the center-left Social Democrats in the regional election in Germany's biggest state on Sunday  exit polls said  providing a major boost to the German leader ahead of national elections in September.
The center-right Christian Democrats beat the Social Democrats 34.5% to 30.5% in the state election in North Rhine-Westphalia  according to exit polls released by ARD public television.
The result represented a major upset in German politics and underlined Ms. Merkel's political strength as she prepares to run for a fourth term.
