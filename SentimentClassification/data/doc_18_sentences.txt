15:18 ET - Oracle (ORCL) co-CEO Mark Hurd says the giant software company welcomes trained immigrants to its workforce.
In a meeting with journalists at ORCL headquarters  Hurd says he doesn't want "the company to become political."
While co-CEO Safra Catz served on President Trump's transition committee  Hurd notes that ORCL was not involved in politics during the election.
He says it makes no sense to welcome immigrants to American universities  but then turn away those US educated workers when they want a job.
"We've been very supportive of hiring trained  immigrant labor " Hurd says.
"We need talented people."
15:06 ET - Self-driving cars  life-extension technology  delivery drones... now add food-replacement drinks to the list of bets by Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).
To be sure  GOOGL isn't itself working on meal replacements  but its early-stage venture arm GV just led a $50M funding round for high-profile startup Soylent  increasing overall funding to $74.5M for the maker of so-called ready-to-drink meals.
GOOGL has said GV operates as a traditional venture fund that targets promising investments  regardless of their market.
GOOGL says its strategic investments typically come from its core business.
But there is other evidence GOOGL thinks food is ripe for disruption.
News reports in 2015 said GOOGL unsuccessfully bid between $200M-$300M for plant-based-burger maker Impossible Foods.
