The event also stars a professional comedian  who uses the event to poke fun at both the press and the administration. </p> <p>Instead of a monologue from Mr. Trump  the event was headlined by veteran journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein  along with comedian Hasan Minhaj. Messrs. Woodward and Bernstein are best known as the investigative reporting team that helped expose the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon&apos;s resignation from office in 1974. Mr. Minhaj is a correspondent on Comedy Central&apos;s &quot;Daily Show.&quot; </p> <p>In his remarks  Mr. Minhaj riffed on Mr. Trump&apos;s absence. </p> <p>&quot;The leader of our country is not here -- and that&apos;s because he lives in Russia &quot; Mr. Minhaj said  joking about allegations that Moscow interfered in the U.S. election. </p> <p>Mr. Trump  he continued  &quot;tweets at 3 a.m. sober. Who is tweeting at 3 a.m. sober? Donald Trump  because it&apos;s 10 a.m. in Russia. Those are business hours.&quot; </p> <p>At the event  which lacked the sizable Hollywood contingent of prior years  prizes were awarded to Greg Jaffe and David Fahrenthold of the Washington Post  and Edward-Isaac Dovere of Politico. The association also awarded nearly two dozen scholarships to college students from Columbia University  George Washington University  Howard University and others. </p> <p>Mr. Trump decided in February that he would not attend the event  writing on his Twitter account: &quot;I will not be attending the White House Correspondents&apos; Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening.&quot; </p> <p>This week  Mr. Trump told Reuters that he skipped the dinner because he felt that media coverage of the opening chapters of his presidency has been unfair. </p> <p>&quot;I would come next year  absolutely &quot; Mr. Trump told Reuters. </p> <p>Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason is also the president of the White House Correspondents&apos; Association. </p> <p>&quot;The WHCA congratulates our award winners and looks forward to honoring them at our annual dinner  which will be a celebration of the First Amendment and good journalism &quot; Mr. Mason said in a statement. </p> <p>In deciding to skip the black-tie affair  Mr. Trump became the first chief executive since 1981 to miss the dinner. That year  President Ronald Reagan missed the event after an assassination attempt outside the same hotel where the annual dinner is now held. Before that  President Jimmy Carter didn&apos;t attend in 1978 and 1980  while Richard Nixon didn&apos;t show up in 1972 and 1974. </p> <p>Even without Mr. Trump&apos;s participation  many of the annual events around the weekend that is sometimes dubbed &quot;nerd prom&quot; went forward as usual. News outlets such as CNN  MSNBC  Reuters  the Associated Press  Bloomberg  Real Clear Politics  the Washington Post and others held parties celebrating the White House press corps  sponsored by advocacy groups such as Voto Latino  the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States and others. </p> <p>The  held its annual pre-party at the Washington Hilton on Saturday. </p> <p>Natalie Andrews contributed to this article. </p> <p>   Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau </p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 01  2017 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000007896 md5=5dc492d2dfa6de1145241aca11649b8f sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170501 product=DN seq=547 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=DB accession-number=0501000547 page-citation=B2 display-date=20170501T063242.263Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Kerkorian&apos;s Final Bet: A Film -- </headline> <text> <pre> By Erich Schwartzel </pre> <p>LOS ANGELES -- In the final days of his decades in deal-making  Kirk Kerkorian made an investment many in Hollywood would view as a bet with extremely long odds. </p> <p>The billionaire businessman handed over about $100 million to make &quot;The Promise &quot; a love story set amid the collapse of the Ottoman Empire that ranks among the most expensive independent films released this year. Without a studio attached to distribute it or a script based on a well-known TV show or comic book  this type of feature is all but impossible to produce in today&apos;s Hollywood without a deep-pocketed  passionate benefactor. </p> <p>Mr. Kerkorian fit the bill. One of the most prominent Americans of Armenian descent  the hotel and entertainment mogul had spent decades backing Armenian charities around the world. Mr. Kerkorian&apos;s financing of &quot;Promise&quot; is now a prominent piece of the Armenian community&apos;s campaign to secure genocide classification for the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks that began in 1915  a choice that put the movie in the middle of a 102-year-old controversy that has political reverberations today. </p> <p>Mr. Kerkorian and his producers envisioned a movie like &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; or &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; that would become a touchstone cinematic portrayal of historical atrocities. </p> <p>Despite a poor opening at the box office  &quot;The Promise&quot; appears to be the first of many ways that Mr. Kerkorian&apos;s $4 billion fortune could continue to influence Hollywood and global politics since his death nearly two years ago. The movie is a key element of a broader effort by Mr. Kerkorian&apos;s estate to raise awareness of human-rights violations throughout history. </p> <p>Mr. Kerkorian died in 2015 at the age of 98 before production on &quot;The Promise&quot; began  but he made the movie&apos;s agenda clear. </p> <p>&quot;He didn&apos;t want it to be a history lesson or a lecture &quot; said Eric Esrailian  a Los Angeles gastroenterologist who met Mr. Kerkorian several years ago. &quot;But he wanted to introduce people to the Armenian genocide.&quot; </p> <p>Mr. Esrailian&apos;s full-time job is in medicine  but he is also charged with overseeing a significant and potentially powerful piece of Mr. Kerkorian&apos;s estate: Survival Pictures  a production company that began work with &quot;The Promise&quot; and may develop more movies in the future. </p> <p>&quot;The Promise&quot; wades into a geopolitical battle over how the Armenian killings are classified. Every sitting U.S. president since Ronald Reagan has refrained from calling them a &quot;genocide &quot; avoiding a term that angers Turkey. However  the United Nations  Roman Catholic Church and many other organizations and experts put the killing of nearly 1.5 million Armenians in the same class of atrocity as the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s. </p> <p>After actor Daniel Gim& <p>&quot;He said  &apos;Why do you say it&apos;s a genocide? You are not well informed &apos; &quot; Mr. Cacho says in the film. Representatives for Mr. Cacho  who is Mexican  and the Turkish embassy in Mexico didn&apos;t respond to requests for comment. </p> <p>&quot;We really had a hard time casting Turkish actors &quot; said producer William Horberg. &quot;They thought it could affect their careers.&quot; </p> <p>&quot;Intent to Destroy&quot; premiered Tuesday at this year&apos;s Tribeca Film Festival  and Mr. Kerkorian&apos;s estate donated $20 million to the law school at the University of California  Los Angeles  to establish the Promise Institute for Human Rights  loosely modeled after the Shoah Foundation  started by Steven Spielberg following the release of his Holocaust drama &quot;Schindler&apos;s List.&quot; </p> <p>Though it features A-list stars Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale as two men in love with the same Armenian woman  &quot;The Promise&quot; has barely registered at the box office. Since it opened on April 21  the movie  which was released by Open Road Films  has collected a paltry $7 million in the U.S. and Canada. </p> <p>If a studio had financed the movie  that gross would rank among the worst returns on investment in Hollywood history. Mr. Kerkorian&apos;s estate backed the entire production  and any box-office revenue that flows back to Survival Pictures is being donated to charity  said Mr. Esrailian. He said Mr. Kerkorian&apos;s goal was education  not box-office proceeds. </p> <p>&quot;We made this movie for 100 years  not just two days &quot; he said  referring to the film&apos;s opening weekend. </p> <p>Mr. Kerkorian died after a long career in real estate and entertainment. A key player in building modern-day Las Vegas  he acquired the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio in 1969 and opened the original MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in 1973. He bought and sold the studio three times  and had a net worth of $4.2 billion when he died  according to Forbes. He is believed by Armenian rights groups to have donated a total of $1 billion to Armenian causes in his lifetime. </p> <p>Soon after the movie&apos;s premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last September  thousands of one-star reviews of the film flooded IMDb.com  the popular movie website owned by Amazon.com Inc. </p> <p>The onslaught of negative reviews was traced to social-media campaigns against the film on Turkish websites. One text-message campaign in Turkey read  &quot;Please go to Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb and rate this 1/2 a star. Let&apos;s drop its ratings &quot; according to a screenshot provided by an Armenian activist. Similar language appeared on a Turkish social-media site reviewed by The . </p> <p>&quot;The Promise&quot; currently has more than 144 000 reviews on the site  about 50 000 more than the year&apos;s top-grossing movie  &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot; </p> <p></p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 01  2017 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000002239 md5=e8e6a11126b18bd4802f8afaa2f072cd sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170501 product=DN seq=4202 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=T accession-number=0501004202 page-citation= display-date=20170501T134340.699Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Trump Just Warming Up on growth  -- Market Talk</headline> <text> <p>   09:43 ET - Bank of America Merrill Lynch calls President Trump&apos;s approval of Keystone and Dakota-Access pipelines &quot;just a warm up&quot; as he begins unleashing the energy sector. &quot;Energy is a policy cornerstone  together with tax reform  in this administration.&quot; As Trump targets job creation and economic growth  the investment bank says &quot;for the energy sector  this means more access to Federal land and water resources and less regulation.

It reported the latest delay in a securities filing. Completion of the Kemper County  Miss  facility has been plagued by delays and cost overruns. The total cost of the facility  not including federal grants  is $5.75B. The facility is intended to turn coal into gas  which can be burned to generate electricity. The carbon dioxide output will be captured and injected into oil fields to boost production. The company said the latest due to repairs to a leak in a control device and medication to an ash-removal system.  </p> <p>   09:22 ET - Hedge fund stockpickers showed some pluck in 1Q 2017 as long/short strategies notched their best start to any year since 2013. Long/short strategies posted an average advance of 3.5% in 1Q  according to Mark Connors  head of prime services at Credit Suisse. That compares with a dismal 3.4% decline in the first quarter of 2016. Since the election  analysts have forecast that lower stock market correlations and higher dispersion would make a more hospitable environment for picking stocks. Connors notes that those long/short funds heavy in tech stocks fared best. (chris.dieterich) </p> <p>   9:18 ET - There&apos;s an ominous undercurrent to the unexpectedly cooling off in March inflation. A key inflation expectations gauge produced by the New York Fed has also seen weakness of late  with the public predicting slower price gains over the one and three year horizons. While it&apos;s too soon to say the long slog to get inflation back to the Fed&apos;s 2% targeted rise is over  it&apos;s also possible the promised land may be more elusive given economists&apos; view that where the public expects inflation to go is a powerful driver of its current performance. It&apos;s another reason to believe the Fed&apos;s campaign to raise rates may not be as straightforward as it now seems to be.  </p> <p> </p> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 01  2017 09:43 ET (13:43 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000009858 md5=a9f4398d71dd773d4179dc9b4b8bcacc sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170501 product=DN seq=4251 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=T accession-number=0501004251 page-citation= display-date=20170501T135000.000Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Valeant Sees Progress in Unscheduled Debt Payment -- Market Talk</headline> <text> <p>   09:50 ET - Its $220M debt payment Friday was just a drop in the bucket for Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX)  which faces more than $28B in debt from a dealmaking binge under the previous chief executive.

It&apos;s whether they will implement it or not.&quot; </p> <p>The document  unveiled Monday in the Qatar capital Doha  allows Mr. Abbas to display a united Palestinian front when he meets the U.S. president  Palestinian officials said. </p> <p>Israel has repeatedly highlighted the division between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority as proof that it doesn&apos;t have a Palestinian partner for peace. Hamas rules the Gaza Strip  while the Palestinian Authority  which is dominated by Mr. Abbas&apos;s more secular Fatah movement  governs the West Bank. </p> <p>Israel scathingly rejected suggestions that the document  a supplement to the group&apos;s 1988 charter  was anything more than a rhetorical makeover that disguised the determination of Hamas to annihilate Israel. </p> <p>&quot;They dig terror tunnels and have launched thousands upon thousands of missiles at Israeli civilians &quot; said David Keyes  a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. &quot;This is the real Hamas.&quot; </p> <p>Daniel Shapiro  who served as U.S. ambassador to Israel during the Obama administration  suggested that nothing essential about Hamas had changed. The group has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and other Western governments. </p> <p>&quot;It may serve some purpose on the Palestinian or Arab side  but it isn&apos;t fooling anyone on the Israeli or American side &quot; said Mr. Shapiro  now a senior fellow at Tel Aviv&apos;s Institute for National Security Studies. </p> <p>Arab nations and Turkey were likely to withhold comment until after the White House meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Abbas  the Palestinian official said. </p> <p>In recent weeks  Mr. Abbas has put financial pressure on Hamas in an apparent attempt to show Mr. Trump that he understands the importance of bringing some semblance of unity to Palestinian government and politics. </p> <p>&quot;If Abbas is smart enough he can use it [the document of principles] to show that everyone is under his umbrella &quot; Mahdi Abdul Hadi  head of the Jerusalem-based Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs. </p> <p>The &quot;Document of General Principles and Policies&quot; also more explicitly defines Hamas as a national movement to create a Palestinian state  distancing it from the Muslim Brotherhood  which has branches in Egypt and across the region. </p> <p>Until Monday  Hamas had rejected the notion of a Palestinian state within 1967 borders  a longstanding position of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization  which Israel officially recognized in 1993 as the representative of the Palestinian people. </p> <p>Hamas head Khaled Mashaal said at Monday night&apos;s announcement in Doha that Hamas was willing to enter negotiations with Israel. But the document of principles doesn&apos;t recognize the state of Israel and indicates that in time  Hamas will control all of what is now Israel. </p> <p>An Israeli official said Hamas&apos;s approach remained different from the Authority&apos;s. </p> <p>&quot;Instead of trying to destroy us in one go  they will do it two goes &quot; the official said. The charter is &quot;cosmetics and nothing more.&quot; </p> <p> </p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 02  2017 11:32 ET (15:32 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc>

Joe Walsh  who is now a conservative talk radio host  on Tuesday wrote on Twitter: &quot;Got a big problem with &apos;we need gov-run healthcare cuz of my sad story.&apos;&quot; </p> <p>   On his television show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; Monday night  Mr. Kimmel recounted the birth and subsequent medical care of his son  who has a congenital heart defect  arguing it showed the urgency of preserving protections for people who have pre-existing health conditions. During the monologue  Mr. Kimmel made an emotional plea: &quot;No parent should ever have to decide if they can afford to save their child&apos;s life.&quot; </p> <p>   His comments  which Democrats opposed to the GOP repeal effort quickly lauded  came as House Republican leaders try this week to get enough support to pass their health proposal. </p> <p>   The 2010 Affordable Care Act  known widely as Obamacare  barred insurers from charging higher premiums to individuals with pre-existing medical conditions. </p> <p>   After promising since 2010 to repeal Obamacare  GOP leaders since January have been struggling to craft legislation that strips away many of the ACA requirements aggressively enough to appease conservatives while maintaining enough protections to preserve support from centrist Republicans. </p> <p>   The House GOP leadership&apos;s health-care bill could let insurers in some states charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing health conditions who let their coverage lapse. A number of centrist Republicans have been concerned that breaks their promise to protect guaranteed coverage provided now in the ACA. </p> <p>   Mr. Kimmel&apos;s comments Monday  delivered during a tearful opening monologue  came just as many moderate Republicans said they were still undecided on whether to support the proposal. Republicans have also been seeking to build public support for their plan  arguing Tuesday that the proposal doesn&apos;t gut protections for people who are sick or have expensive medical conditions. </p> <p>   The legislation &quot;helps us lower premiums while keeping protections for the most vulnerable in place &quot; House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday in a statement. </p> <p>   But Democrats have seen Mr. Kimmel&apos;s comments as an opening to sway public support against repeal efforts. </p> <p>  </p> <pre></pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 02  2017 17:41 ET (21:41 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000006921 md5=2e1f7a7704f07fe55f3cd352e3fdc9a1 sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170502 product=DN seq=16966 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=DB accession-number=0502016966 page-citation= display-date=20170502T224101.838Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Trump  Putin Discuss Crises in Syria and on Korean Peninsula -- Update</headline> <text> <pre> By Carol E.

U.S. officials suggested Russia may have known in advance of the regime carrying it out. </p> <p>Mr. Trump responded by ordering missile strikes on a Syrian airfield. </p> <p>Mr. Trump has been exploring the option of creating unofficial safe zones in Syria  dubbed &quot;interim de-escalation areas&quot; by some U.S. officials  along the Turkey and Jordan borders.

It&apos;s whether they will implement it or not.&quot; </p> <p>The document  unveiled Monday in the Qatar capital Doha  allows Mr. Abbas to display a united Palestinian front when he meets the U.S. president  Palestinian officials said. </p> <p>Israel has repeatedly highlighted the division between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority as proof that it doesn&apos;t have a Palestinian partner for peace. Hamas rules the Gaza Strip  while the Palestinian Authority  which is dominated by Mr. Abbas&apos;s more secular Fatah movement  governs the West Bank. </p> <p>Israel scathingly rejected suggestions that the document  a supplement to the group&apos;s 1988 charter  was anything more than a rhetorical makeover that disguised the determination of Hamas to annihilate Israel. </p> <p>&quot;They dig terror tunnels and have launched thousands upon thousands of missiles at Israeli civilians &quot; said David Keyes  a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. &quot;This is the real Hamas.&quot; </p> <p>Daniel Shapiro  who served as U.S. ambassador to Israel during the Obama administration  suggested that nothing essential about Hamas had changed. The group has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and other Western governments. </p> <p>&quot;It may serve some purpose on the Palestinian or Arab side  but it isn&apos;t fooling anyone on the Israeli or American side &quot; said Mr. Shapiro  now a senior fellow at Tel Aviv&apos;s Institute for National Security Studies. </p> <p>Arab nations and Turkey were likely to withhold comment until after the White House meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Abbas  the Palestinian official said. </p> <p>In recent weeks  Mr. Abbas has put financial pressure on Hamas in an apparent attempt to show Mr. Trump that he understands the importance of bringing some semblance of unity to Palestinian government and politics. </p> <p>&quot;If Abbas is smart enough he can use it [the document of principles] to show that everyone is under his umbrella &quot; Mahdi Abdul Hadi  head of the Jerusalem-based Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs. </p> <p>The &quot;Document of General Principles and Policies&quot; also more explicitly defines Hamas as a national movement to create a Palestinian state  distancing it from the Muslim Brotherhood  which has branches in Egypt and across the region. </p> <p>Until Monday  Hamas had rejected the notion of a Palestinian state within 1967 borders  a longstanding position of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization  which Israel officially recognized in 1993 as the representative of the Palestinian people. </p> <p>Hamas head Khaled Mashaal said at Monday night&apos;s announcement in Doha that Hamas was willing to enter negotiations with Israel. But the document of principles doesn&apos;t recognize the state of Israel and indicates that in time  Hamas will control all of what is now Israel. </p> <p>An Israeli official said Hamas&apos;s approach remained different from the Authority&apos;s. </p> <p>&quot;Instead of trying to destroy us in one go  they will do it two goes &quot; the official said. The charter is &quot;cosmetics and nothing more.&quot; </p> <p>  </p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 03  2017 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000003245 md5=d56460a7befcf1b19c60de347104d9d9 sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170503 product=DN seq=5225 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=T accession-number=0503005224 page-citation= display-date=20170503T114757.443Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Capital Journal: GOP&apos;s Health-Bill Woes  More -2-</headline> <text> <p>   French business executives &quot;are ditching  their traditional reluctance to speak publicly about politics  openly supporting independent Emmanuel Macron in the May 7 presidential runoff against Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front &quot; reports Carol Matlack of Bloomberg. </p> <p>   President Donald Trump is right to suggest  willingness to talk with some of the world&apos;s bad actors  including North Korea&apos;s leader Kim Jong Un  writes David Ignatius of the Washington Post.

Many disaffected voters are expected to avail themselves of this option in Sunday&apos;s final round contest between pro-European Union centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen. </p> <p>Under current election rules  however  the so-called ballot blanc  or white ballot  is purely symbolic. Mr. Guyot  who leads the advocacy group Citizens of the White Ballot  wants to change that and turn the protest vote into a giant electoral eraser. </p> <p>Candidates in French presidential elections need more than 50% of vote to win. If white ballots were included in the official tally  Mr. Guyot says  voters could use them to deprive candidates of an absolute majority and force fresh elections. &quot;It would be very efficient &quot; he says. </p> <p>In the first round of the presidential election in April  there were about 660 000 white ballots cast -- higher than the total vote tallies for five of the 11 candidates running. </p> <p>Pollsters  who predict Mr. Macron will handily defeat Ms. Le Pen  are also forecasting a record high number of white ballots on Sunday  with a large number of voters expected to abstain in one form or another. Turnout is expected be the lowest since 1969  according to a poll published Friday by Odoxa. </p> <p>After mainstream candidates were sidelined in the April 23 first round  these voters now say they don&apos;t identify with the positions of either Mr. Macron -- who wants to reinvigorate EU integration -- or Ms. Le Pen -- who says France would be better off out of the bloc and the euro. </p> <p>That could weaken the hand of the next president  whose immediate challenge will be to secure a workable majority in the French parliament in legislative elections set for next month. </p> <p>&quot;Macron and Marine Le Pen  they don&apos;t represent me. They don&apos;t represent more than 50% of the French people &quot; says Vincent Masserot  a 32-year-old who works for an insurance company and says he will cast a white ballot. </p> <p>Anti-establishment politician Jacques Cheminade  who was eliminated in the first round of the presidential polls after winning just 65 000 votes -- far behind the number of white ballots cast -- says he is planning to cast one on Sunday. </p> <p>&quot;I cannot bring myself to vote for either&quot; Mr. Macron or Ms. Le Pen  he said. </p> <p>Ahead of the final round  the white ballot has come under attack  mainly by mainstream politicians  who say choosing nobody amounts to giving Ms. Le Pen a chance to reach the Elys& <p>Olivier Durand  a longtime backer of the white-ballot cause  says attempts to blame or shame white-ballot voters amount to &quot;a stupid strategy&quot; and &quot;a source of future bitterness.&quot; </p> <p>The concept of blank protest votes isn&apos;t unique to France. </p> <p>In India  the world&apos;s largest democracy  voters can now choose &quot;none of the above&quot; in national elections. In the U.S.  Nevada allows voters to check a special box when they favor none of the candidates on the ballot. Those votes have no practical effect on the outcome  however. </p> <p>In France  there has been some support among mainstream politicians for changes to the voting system  which is geared to winnow a field of candidates and produce a winner with a clear majority. </p> <p>The French parliament in 2014 passed a law mandating that blank ballots be counted and the totals published alongside election results. But the legislation didn&apos;t incorporate the white ballots into the official tallies that affect the outcome of elections. </p> <p>&quot;They were too scared of the vote for no one &quot; said Mr. Guyot. </p> <p>Mr. Guyot  a 48-year-old florist  has continued to press his grassroots operation. Citizens of the White Ballot organized gatherings to rally supporters. Mr. Guyot met with an aide to President Fran& <p>As this year&apos;s elections approached  Mr. Guyot attempted his own presidential run to promote his view that white ballots should count. </p> <p>He travelled the country in a crisp white shirt brandishing a blank piece of paper. He pledged to do nothing if elected.

Using the turnout figures from the government  polling company Ipsos Sopra-Steria estimated that the final level of abstention will be 26%  the highest since the 1969 election. </p> <p>Polls conducted before voting began predicted Mr. Macron would win the vote with a 20-percentage-point margin  a result that would come as a relief to defenders of the EU after a long streak of advances by nationalist leaders on the continent. </p> <p>Even if she loses with 40%  however  Ms. Le Pen could still seek to build on her results--expected to be the best for a far-right presidential candidate in modern French history--to become a powerful opposition leader  and further promote her protectionist ideas. </p> <p>&quot;Marine Le Pen at 40% across France in a presidential election would already be colossal &quot; said J& <p>The two candidates are offering to steer France in polar-opposite directions. Ms. Le Pen pledges to extricate the country from the EU and the euro  shutting borders to immigrants and cheap imports she says harm the domestic economy. Mr. Macron says France should embrace the EU and not fear globalization  vowing unpopular overhauls of labor laws to make the country more competitive. </p> <p>&quot;I am the candidate of the nation that protects; protects our jobs  security and borders &quot; Ms. Le Pen said in a TV debate with Mr. Macron on Wednesday. Mr. Macron said isolationism would lead to defeat. &quot;I represent the mind-set of conquest &quot; he said. </p> <p>A narrow victory for Mr. Macron would erode the authority of a candidate already relying on the support of millions of voters who reject his policies but who say they will vote for him anyway to bar Ms. Le Pen from reaching the presidency. </p> <p>A poll by BVA this week showed about two thirds of people intending to vote for Mr. Macron were doing so to block Ms. Le Pen or because they see him as the least-bad option. </p> <p>After casting his ballot in Ris-Orangis  20 miles south of Paris  Maurice Attuil said he reluctantly voted for Mr. Macron. </p> <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t want either. I voted for Macron because we don&apos;t really have a choice. I don&apos;t want to vote for extremists. Macron was part of the last government that did nothing &quot; said Mr. Attuil  a 63-year-old plumber. </p> <p>Pascal Martin  a 49-year-old English teacher in Paris  voted for Ms. Le Pen. &quot;It&apos;s a vote against the main parties and the political mainstream  &quot; he said. &quot;These guys and Macron in particular just think about themselves. Macron is from finance and I&apos;ll never  ever be able to vote for him.&quot; </p> <p>Mr. Macron&apos;s party was hit by a hacking scandal in the final moments of the campaign Friday evening when thousands of emails and documents purporting to come from the party were posted on the internet. En Marche said authentic documents obtained from the hacking of email accounts were mixed with fakes &quot;with the goal of sowing doubt and disinformation.&quot; </p> <p>The timing of the document dump Friday indicates the hackers calculated the leak to inflict maximum damage. Because of election laws in France  En Marche and Mr. Macron were prohibited from communicating about the authenticity of the documents Saturday and until all polls close Sunday at 8 p.m. </p> <p>If Mr. Macron wins  the first hurdle he would face would be securing a majority in legislative elections in mid-June. His upstart political movement has refused to seal alliances with mainstream parties  and has only named a handful of candidates it intends to field in the 577 seats up for grabs. </p> <p>If Mr. Macron fails to secure a majority  he would have to seek ad hoc alliances with opposition parties or could even be forced into a so-called &quot;cohabitation&quot;--a form of power-sharing under which a prime minister from the opposition runs the government. </p> <p>&quot;Mr. Macron is 39 years old and has come from nowhere to end up president. To continue to assert himself it is important to get more than 60% in the presidential election &quot; said Bruno Jeanbart at polling company Opinionway. &quot;A 57% score would be catastrophic.&quot; </p> <p>Alexis Reguigne  an architect in Paris  said the margin of a Macron victory was crucial for sending a message. </p> <p>&quot;If Mr. Macron gets a large majority--beyond 70%  twice as many votes as Marine Le Pen--then that&apos;s a clear opposition to extremism. What&apos;s been announced is insufficient. She needs to be well beaten  even if it is very important to understand why so many people are voting for her &quot; said Mr. Reguigne  who refused to indicate how he had voted. </p> <p>It isn&apos;t the first time the National Front has reached the second round of a presidential election. In 2002  Ms. Le Pen&apos;s father  Jean-Marie Le Pen  qualified for a runoff against conservative Jacques Chirac. After he lost with less than 18% of the vote  the National Front retreated to a protest movement. </p> <p>Since taking over from her father in 2011  Ms. Le Pen has sought to broaden her party&apos;s appeal and distance herself from the xenophobic legacy of her father. </p> <p>Ms. Le Pen&apos;s strategy has been on display between the two rounds of the election as she attempted to reach out to all sides of the political spectrum. </p> <p>She went after blue-collar votes by posing for photos with workers at a factory threatened with closure  just before Mr. Macron was due at the same site.

While markets anticipated the win  the next test will be whether the renewed sense of solidarity in European politics leads to progress on issues that have long dogged the economic bloc. </p> <p>In the near term  markets have already been inspired by the fading of European political risk. Elections in Austria  the Netherlands  and now France show Europeans leaning toward repairing the European Union and its common currency  the euro  rather than breaking it apart. </p> <p>Since the first round of the French presidential elections two weeks ago  European stocks have gained 4.3%  with French stocks up more than 7%. Credit spreads have tightened  French bond yields fallen and the euro traded Friday at $1.10  up around three cents since April 23. That implies some of the relief investors will feel from Mr. Macron&apos;s win has already been priced in. Markets have been further buoyed by the relative strength and resilience of eurozone economic data. </p> <p>How could Mr. Macron&apos;s election keep the momentum going for European markets? A focus will be on whether he renews the relationship between France and Germany  a key development in potentially delivering greater European integration  such as strengthening the eurozone&apos;s banking union and crisis-response capabilities. Efforts to improve the functioning of capital markets in Europe too would be welcome. That would inspire longer term confidence about the ability of the euro to thrive  even if ideas like fiscal union remain on the drawing board. </p> <p>An important part of that will be Mr. Macron&apos;s ability to reform France  boosting growth that has lagged behind that of Germany in recent years; to have the two biggest economies in the eurozone moving in tandem will be a powerful force. Vital tasks include making labor markets more flexible in an effort to lower French unemployment from 10%  as well as reducing public spending. </p> <p>Another litmus test for progress will be Greece  whose financial crisis has been grinding on for seven years. A renewed Franco-German axis could perhaps find some way to agree a restructuring of Greece&apos;s debt. Ten-year Greek bond yields have fallen below 6% for the first time since 2014 as hopes have built of a deal with creditors. </p> <p>One area to watch out for is less positive  and centers on Italy  and its weak growth and high debt. One consequence of Mr. Macron&apos;s win is that investors are likely to focus again on prospects for the European Central Bank winding down its bond-purchase program: Italian bond yields could rise as a result. And Italian politics remain a wild card  even if an election might not occur until next year. Continued strong support for the antiestablishment and euroskeptic 5 Star Movement could rattle markets anew. </p> <p>The election of Mr. Macron is a step forward for Europe -- but in a system with so many moving parts  it is a necessary  not a sufficient condition for progress. Still  combined with a recovery in corporate profits and decent economic data  the pro-European story has the upper hand. </p> <p></p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 07  2017 14:37 ET (18:37 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000009097 md5=9883db08e7decf82dc89db3e4a22e894 sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170507 product=DN seq=813 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=DB accession-number=0507000813 page-citation= display-date=20170507T190422.021Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Emmanuel Macron Wins French Presidency -- Update</headline> <text> <pre> By William Horobin and Stacy Meichtry </pre> <p>PARIS -- Emmanuel Macron was elected president of France Sunday in a watershed victory that hands the political newcomer a strong mandate to overhaul France&apos;s economy and reverse a tide of nationalism sweeping the European Union. </p> <p>Early projections showed 65.5% of voters cast ballots for Mr. Macron  a 39-year-old former investment banker who has vowed to undertake contentious labor reforms in France as part of a push for greater economic convergence among the European Union&apos;s fractious member states. </p> <p>Marine Le Pen  who ran on a plan to pull the country out of the euro and close its borders to migrants  took 34.5%. She conceded minutes after early projections were announced Sunday. </p> <p>Mr. Macron will become the youngest president in French history at a time when France and the European Union  the 60-year political project it helped found  face major challenges. </p> <p>Nearly a decade of lost economic growth for many EU countries has fueled the rise of Ms. Le Pen and other nationalists across the Continent  emboldened by the British vote to leave the EU  or Brexit  and the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. </p> <p>In conceding defeat  Ms. Le Pen vowed to refashion her far-right National Front party as the country&apos;s leading opposition force. </p> <p>&quot;This run-off brought a major reconfiguration of the political order around the divide between patriots and globalists &quot; Ms. Le Pen said. </p> <p>In the coming weeks  Mr. Macron will face a scramble to build his fledgling political party  En Marche  or &quot;On the Move &quot; into a political force capable of winning a majority in June&apos;s legislative elections. Without Parliament&apos;s backing  he risks becoming a mere figurehead unable to fulfill his campaign promises. </p> <p>Mr. Macron&apos;s election marks a major victory by the pro-EU establishment. He ran as a staunch defender of the bloc  positioning himself as a bulwark against Europe&apos;s nationalist wave. The strategy broke with parts of France&apos;s political mainstream that had been gravitating toward more populist positions. </p> <p>Mr. Macron has said the EU&apos;s future depends on whether its shaky architecture can undergo a root-and-branch overhaul to correct stark economic imbalances among wealthier Northern and poorer Southern members and develop a security apparatus able to protect the bloc from terror attacks and control a recent wave of migration. </p> <p>For that to happen  he says  France needs to set an example among countries that have been slow to embrace economic restructuring by loosening its own rigid labor market to become more competitive with stronger neighbors like Germany. </p> <p>Those mammoth tasks fall to a relative newcomer to politics. Until now  Mr. Macron has never held elected office.

Bender </pre> <p>President Donald Trump on Tuesday unexpectedly fired FBI Director James Comey  plunging the capital into confusion and immediately intensifying calls for a special prosecutor to assume control of the highly sensitive investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. </p> <p>The reason for the firing  according to White House and Justice Department officials  was Mr. Comey&apos;s much-criticized handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton&apos;s use of a private email server while secretary of state. The White House said Mr. Trump relied on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. </p> <p>The Trump administration released a memo dated Tuesday from Mr. Rosenstein who offered a blistering assessment of Mr. Comey&apos;s conduct  calling his actions &quot;troubling&quot; and saying he had harmed the FBI&apos;s credibility and had refused to learn from his errors. </p> <p>Mr. Comey&apos;s chief spokesman at the FBI  Michael Kortan  didn&apos;t return phone calls seeking comment. Sarah Isgur Flores  a Justice Department spokeswoman  referred calls to the White House  which issued a short statement from Mr. Trump that said &quot;today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement.&quot; </p> <p>The startling action is likely to raise as many questions as it answers and result in long-term fallout  thrusting the Russia probe in particular into unknown territory. Mr. Trump will face enormous pressure to choose a figure who is beyond reproach to replace Mr. Comey. It will be up to Mr. Rosenstein whether to name a special prosecutor  and he  too  will face great pressure to do so. </p> <p>The FBI is currently investigating whether members of Mr. Trump&apos;s campaign collaborated with the Russian government to influence the presidential election. Mr. Trump and his staff have dismissed allegations of Russian collusion  and Russia has denied interfering in the election. </p> <p>Democrats were quick to stress the questions raised by a president firing an individual who is in the middle of investigating his administration and campaign. The move also highlighted the fraught position of FBI directors  who are often caught between the need to pursue investigations in an impartial way and the political storms in which they operate. </p> <p>The memo  and the White House efforts to paint the decision as one tied directly to the unfair handling of the Clinton email probe  were blasted by Democrats. They pointed out that Mr. Trump had chastised Mr. Comey on the campaign trail for not seeking charges against Mrs. Clinton for sending and receiving classified information on a private email system. </p> <p>Democrats also called the firing &quot;Nixonian&quot; and urged the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate potential collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign  something that Mr. Rosenstein has resisted. They immediately compared Mr. Trump&apos;s move to the notorious Saturday Night Massacre in 1973  when the attorney general and the deputy attorney general resigned after refusing President Richard Nixon&apos;s order to fire a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. </p> <p>&quot;The President&apos;s actions today make it clear to me that a Special Counsel also must be appointed &quot; Sen. Mark Warner (D.  Va.)  the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee  which is conducting a probe into the alleged Russian interference  said in a statement. &quot;That&apos;s the only way the American people will be able to trust the results of any DOJ investigation.&quot; </p> <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D.  N.Y.) said: &quot;If Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein does not appoint an independent special prosecutor  every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire Director Comey was part of a cover-up.&quot; </p> <p>Richard Burr  the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee  said in a statement: &quot;I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey&apos;s termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order  and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.&quot; </p> <p>Sen. John McCain (R.  Ariz.) has been calling for a special bipartisan congressional committee  separate from the House and Senate Intelligence committees  to investigate Russian meddling in the election  but Republican leaders have so far rejected that request. He said &quot;the president&apos;s decision to remove the FBI Director only confirms the need and the urgency of such a committee.&quot; </p> <p>The firing of an FBI director is a rare occurrence in the nation&apos;s history. After the decadeslong tenure of J.

Bender </pre> <p>President Donald Trump on Tuesday unexpectedly fired FBI Director James Comey  plunging the capital into confusion and immediately intensifying calls for a special prosecutor to assume control of the highly sensitive investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. </p> <p>The reason for the firing  according to White House and Justice Department officials  was Mr. Comey&apos;s much-criticized handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton&apos;s use of a private email server while secretary of state. The White House said Mr. Trump relied on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. </p> <p>The Trump administration released a memo dated Tuesday from Mr. Rosenstein who offered a blistering assessment of Mr. Comey&apos;s conduct  calling his actions &quot;troubling&quot; and saying he had harmed the FBI&apos;s credibility and had refused to learn from his errors. </p> <p>Mr. Comey&apos;s chief spokesman at the FBI  Michael Kortan  didn&apos;t return phone calls seeking comment. Sarah Isgur Flores  a Justice Department spokeswoman  referred calls to the White House  which issued a short statement from Mr. Trump that said &quot;today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement.&quot; </p> <p>The startling action is likely to raise as many questions as it answers and result in long-term fallout  thrusting the Russia probe in particular into unknown territory. Mr. Trump will face enormous pressure to choose a figure who is beyond reproach to replace Mr. Comey. It will be up to Mr. Rosenstein whether to name a special prosecutor  and he  too  will face great pressure to do so. </p> <p>The FBI is investigating whether members of Mr. Trump&apos;s campaign collaborated with the Russian government to influence the presidential election. Mr. Trump and his staff have dismissed allegations of Russian collusion  and Russia has denied interfering in the election. </p> <p>Mr. Trump is planning to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the White House on Wednesday. It is the Russian envoy&apos;s first visit to Washington since 2013. </p> <p>Democrats were quick to stress the questions raised by a president firing an individual who is in the middle of investigating his administration and campaign. The move also highlighted the fraught position of FBI directors  who are often caught between the need to pursue investigations in an impartial way and the political storms in which they operate. </p> <p>The memo  and the White House efforts to paint the decision as one tied directly to the unfair handling of the Clinton email probe  were blasted by Democrats. They pointed out that Mr. Trump had chastised Mr. Comey on the campaign trail for not seeking charges against Mrs. Clinton for sending and receiving classified information on a private email system. </p> <p>Democrats also called the firing &quot;Nixonian&quot; and urged the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate potential collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign  something that Mr. Rosenstein has resisted. They immediately compared Mr. Trump&apos;s move to the notorious Saturday Night Massacre in 1973  when the attorney general and the deputy attorney general resigned after refusing President Richard Nixon&apos;s order to fire a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. </p> <p>&quot;The President&apos;s actions today make it clear to me that a Special Counsel also must be appointed &quot; Sen. Mark Warner (D.  Va.)  the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee  which is conducting a probe into the alleged Russian interference  said in a statement. &quot;That&apos;s the only way the American people will be able to trust the results of any DOJ investigation.&quot; </p> <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D.  N.Y.) said: &quot;If Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein does not appoint an independent special prosecutor  every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire Director Comey was part of a cover-up.&quot; </p> <p>Richard Burr  the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee  said in a statement: &quot;I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey&apos;s termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order  and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.&quot; </p> <p>Sen. John McCain (R.  Ariz.) has been calling for a special bipartisan congressional committee  separate from the House and Senate Intelligence committees  to investigate Russian meddling in the election  but Republican leaders have so far rejected that request. He said &quot;the president&apos;s decision to remove the FBI Director only confirms the need and the urgency of such a committee.&quot; </p> <p>The firing of an FBI director is a rare occurrence in the nation&apos;s history. After the decadeslong tenure of J. Edgar Hoover  who died in 1972 and was widely seen to have abused his position  directors were given 10-year terms in an attempt to insulate them from politics and prevent them from amassing power  although they serve at the president&apos;s pleasure. </p> <p>Before Mr. Comey  only one previous FBI director had been fired -- William Sessions  dismissed by President Bill Clinton in 1993 after a probe found various ethical lapses. </p> <p>In a letter to Mr. Comey informing him of his dismissal  the president wrote  &quot;While I greatly appreciate you informing me  on three separate occasions  that I am not under investigation  I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.&quot; </p> <p>The three discussions Mr. Trump cited weren&apos;t previously known. It would be unusual for the president and FBI to have such conversations  and it isn&apos;t clear why they would have any relevance to Mr. Comey&apos;s dismissal. </p> <p>&quot;It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission &quot; Mr. Trump wrote in the letter. </p> <p>In an email to FBI employees  Mr. Sessions said the president &quot;has exercised his lawful authority&quot; to remove the director from office.

A person with knowledge of recent conversations said they wanted Mr. Comey to &quot;say those three little words: &apos;There&apos;s no ties.&apos;&quot; </p> <p>In the months before his decision to dismiss Mr. Comey as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  Mr. Trump grew unhappy that the media spotlight kept shining on the director. He viewed Mr. Comey as eager to step in front of TV cameras and questioned whether his expanding media profile was warping his view of the Russia investigation  the officials said. </p> <p>One White House aide  speaking after Mr. Comey&apos;s dismissal  described him as a show horse. </p> <p>&quot;Oh  and there&apos;s James -- he&apos;s become more famous than me &quot; Mr. Trump said as Mr. Comey crossed the room to greet him at a Jan. 22 reception for law enforcement. </p> <p>In firing Mr. Comey  Mr. Trump said he relied on recommendations by his top two Justice Department officials that the FBI needed new leadership. But he made a point of thanking the director for &quot;informing me  on three separate occasions  that I am not under investigation.&quot; </p> <p>That purported detail about the FBI&apos;s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia hadn&apos;t previously been disclosed. The FBI declined to comment. </p> <p>The culmination of those frustrations came with Mr. Comey&apos;s summary dismissal  by letter to FBI headquarters  when Mr. Comey was in Los Angeles to meet with FBI agents and attend a job fair. It marked the dramatic end of a rocky relationship between the two that saw Mr. Trump oscillate between effusive praise for and accusations of wrongdoing against Mr. Comey. </p> <p>His focus on the FBI director began last July  when Mr. Comey  in an extraordinary press conference  said that while Democrat Hillary Clinton had been &quot;extremely careless&quot; in her handling of classified information while secretary of state  the FBI wouldn&apos;t recommend criminal charges against her. Mr. Trump  at a rally later that day  said the system was &quot;rigged&quot; in Mrs. Clinton&apos;s favor and suggested that she had tried to bribe the Justice Department. </p> <p>When Mr. Comey in late October -- weeks before the election -- informed congressional leaders that the FBI had new evidence in the Clinton email probe  effectively reopening the investigation  Mr. Trump praised the move. &quot;What he did  he brought his reputation -- he brought it back &quot; Mr. Trump said at a rally that month. &quot;He&apos;s got to hang tough because a lot of people want him to do the wrong thing. He did the right thing.&quot; </p> <p>Mr. Trump reversed course again when Mr. Comey  just two days before the election  told Congress that the new information in the Clinton probe didn&apos;t change the FBI&apos;s determination not to prosecute. </p> <p>At a rally in Michigan that evening  Mr. Trump accused Mr. Comey again of rigging the system to protect Mrs. Clinton. &quot;You can&apos;t review 650 000 new emails in eight days -- you just can&apos;t do it  folks &quot; he said. &quot;Hillary Clinton is guilty.&quot; </p> <p>Since his election victory  Mr. Trump appeared at times to warm to Mr. Comey  whom Mrs. Clinton has credited with Mr. Trump&apos;s victory. The two hugged at an event shortly after his inauguration  and the president in April defended Mr. Comey&apos;s handling of the email investigation  telling Fox Business Network that the FBI director wanted to &quot;give everybody a good  fair chance.&quot; </p> <p>Critics of Mr. Trump have pointed to his previous statements about Mr. Comey -- including his praise for the FBI&apos;s handling of the Clinton email probe -- as proof that the president&apos;s decision to fire him wasn&apos;t motivated by the reason cited in his dismissal: mistakes made over the handling of the investigation into Mrs. Clinton&apos;s email server. </p> <p>Instead  they suggest that Mr. Trump was seeking to short-circuit the FBI&apos;s investigation into his own associates  noting that as a candidate Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Comey only when he made decisions that adversely affected his campaign. </p> <p>Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway  in a CNN interview late Tuesday  said Mr. Trump&apos;s praise for Mr. Comey&apos;s handling of the email probe during the campaign was irrelevant to his decision to dismiss the FBI director. &quot;You&apos;re looking at the wrong set of facts. You&apos;re going back to the campaign &quot; she said. &quot;This man is the president of the United States.&quot; </p> <p>Since Mr. Trump&apos;s inauguration  a frosty relationship has persisted between him and the FBI director. Associates of Mr. Comey said the director respected the office of the presidency and understood he served at the pleasure of the president. He regularly briefed Mr. Trump on national security matters and had discussions with the president about policy issues  ranging from gang violence to the encryption of communications and devices that is bedeviling law enforcement. </p> <p>He was careful not to release information to the president about the ongoing probe into Russia&apos;s alleged meddling in the U.S. election  however  because Mr. Comey believed doing so would cross ethical and legal boundaries  according to the associates. Mr. Comey told associates before the election and in December that he knew he could be fired but wouldn&apos;t let such fears affect his decision making. He also urged agents investigating Russia&apos;s meddling in the election not to worry about politics or how their probe might affect those in power  an associate said. </p> <p>Mr. Comey was irked when Mr. Trump alleged in early March without any evidence that the Obama administration had tapped the phones of Trump Tower  fearing that what he described to associates as reckless tweets could damage the reputation of the FBI. The agency can only obtain such wiretaps with court approval. He made a point of telling members of Congress later that month at a hearing he had &quot;no information&quot; to support Mr. Trump&apos;s assertions. </p> <p>Last week  ahead of Mr. Comey&apos;s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee -- where he said he feels &quot;mildly nauseous&quot; over the possibility that his actions influenced the election -- Mr. Trump tweeted: &quot;FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!&quot; </p> <p>On Tuesday  an FBI official sent a letter to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee acknowledging that Mr. Comey had overstated evidence stemming from the investigation into Mrs. Clinton&quot;s email use. People familiar with the matter said the mistake sealed Mr. Comey&apos;s fate. Keith Schiller  Mr. Trump&apos;s longtime bodyguard who is director of Oval Office Operations  delivered the letter to FBI headquarters. One person familiar with the matter said Mr. Comey was giving a presentation to field agents when one agent in the presentation got a news alert on his mobile and told the director the report said he was fired. </p> <p>Mr. Comey was in the FBI&apos;s Los Angeles headquarters when he learned of his firing  according to a law-enforcement official. Before he left the office  he addressed hundreds of employees and offered encouragement to them  this official said  adding that the mood was &quot;somber.&quot; News channels later showed a white private jet  reportedly carrying Mr. Comey  taxiing at the airport en route back to Washington. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 10  2017 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000004033 md5=10a6977c61b00bde1e2449016b581292 sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170510 product=DN seq=8880 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=T accession-number=0510008880 page-citation= display-date=20170510T153622.529Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Does the Market Care About Trump Firing Comey? Nope. -- Barron&apos;s Blog</headline> <text> <pre>    </pre> <p>  </p> <p>   It was a shock to everyone when President Donald Trump abruptly fired F.B.I director James Comey -- even to Comey himself  who was speaking to Los Angeles bureau employees when television screens in the background alerted him of the news. The NYTimes reported that Comey laughed at first. He thought it was a prank. </p> <p>   It was no joke. Now Washington D.C. is spinning out with lawmakers calling for a special counsel to take over Comey&apos;s investigation into Russian election meddling  Twitter is lit with  <p>   To be sure  all the usual suspects are up  but not by a lot. The SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD) has gained 0.19% and  United States Oil ( USO) has gained 2.8%. </p> <p>   The big question is: should investors worry about political risk? </p> <p>   Following the election  many predicted that politics was likely to drive the market and market volatility. Indexes have been built to follow Trump stocks  algorithms have been built to alert investors when Trump tweets about a stock they own  and headlines all point to &quot;uncertainty&quot; as the big negative. Yet the VIX hit a 23-year low on Monday. And the market has continued to march along  despite the noise. </p> <p>   It was reasonable for market commentators to discuss implications of unknowns. Today  however  it has become apparent to this blogger that the discussion and agreement of the impact a certain event will have actually voids the event itself. The markets are always pricing in possible future impact  so that by the time the discussions are over and something actually happens  no one cares anymore. </p> <p>   If political risk mattered so much then the volatility should be up with the big &quot;I&quot; for impeachment being discussed again  but the  ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ( VIXY) has fallen 0.26%.

The department is continuing to take a close look at the AT&amp;T deal  a level of scrutiny that was expected given the size  complexity and importance of the transaction. </p> <p>Antitrust enforcement investigations &quot;should be free from any political influence. They will be free if I&apos;m fortunate enough to be confirmed &quot; Mr. Delrahim said during his nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. </p> <p>Mr. Delrahim was one of three Justice Department nominees before the committee Wednesday. All breezed through a hearing that lasted less than an hour  as senators signaled they were preoccupied with Mr. Trump&apos;s surprise dismissal of FBI Director James Comey Tuesday evening. </p> <p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D.  Calif.) used the hearing to raise questions about the timing and reasons behind Mr. Comey&apos;s removal. Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana  the junior Republican on the committee  closed the hearing by joking that there was an opening at the FBI if any of the nominees were interested. </p> <p>Mr. Delrahim currently serves as deputy White House counsel  where his work has focused heavily on judicial nominations. He has a long record in antitrust law  both in private practice and in previous government work. He was a Justice Department antitrust lawyer during the George W. Bush administration and served on a bipartisan commission created by Congress to study the modernization of antitrust laws. </p> <p>Mr. Delrahim fielded only a few questions during Wednesday&apos;s hearing. Federal antitrust law has been traditionally enforced in a bipartisan manner  &quot;and I hope that continues &quot; he told senators. </p> <p>The nominee said he intended to make international antitrust issues a focus  expressing concern that some overseas jurisdictions were using antitrust enforcement improperly to protect domestic businesses at the expense of U.S. companies. </p> <p>Mr. Delrahim&apos;s legal views are considered to be in the traditional conservative mold. Republican antitrust enforcers have tended to be less interventionist than Democrats  though officials from both parties have brought cases against problematic mergers and prosecuted criminal violations like price-fixing. </p> <p>The Obama administration was aggressive in challenging mergers  bringing some cases that a Republican might not. Mr. Delrahim declined to critique the last administration&apos;s record  saying he wasn&apos;t privy to the facts and evidence the department relied upon in making its decisions. </p> <p>Mr. Delrahim reiterated that he would recuse himself from the Justice Department&apos;s continuing litigation against health insurer Anthem Inc.&apos;s bid to acquire Cigna Corp. That is because he did some legal work for Anthem on the transaction when he was in private practice. </p> <p>The department sued to block the deal and won in court in February. The government also won on appeal last month. </p> <p>Anthem hopes to beat the odds and persuade the Supreme Court to hear the case  but it also has said it hopes to negotiate some kind of settlement with the Justice Department now that the Obama team that originally filed the lawsuit is gone. There is no indication  however  that the department  with two court victories in hand  is interested in any such settlement. </p> <p>While there have been sharp political disagreements over some of Mr. Trump&apos;s nominees  Mr. Delrahim&apos;s nomination has received bipartisan support. A dozen previous Justice Department antitrust heads  including those who served in the Obama administration  have signed a letter in support of the nomination. </p> <p>It isn&apos;t clear when the Senate might vote on Mr. Delrahim. </p> <p>Mr. Trump has been slower than other recent presidents to fill antitrust enforcement posts at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission  creating uncertainty for companies with matters pending at the agencies. </p> <p></p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 10  2017 14:28 ET (18:28 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000006598 md5=144bca552a64809d9f7d3f358088047c sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170510 product=DN seq=10938 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=DB accession-number=0510010938 page-citation= display-date=20170510T183717.381Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Dispute in Libya Affects Wintershall Oil Production</headline> <text> <pre> </pre> <p>A dispute between two arms of the Libyan state has ensnared German oil company Wintershall AG  dragging down Libya&apos;s crude production and creating a new obstacle in the country&apos;s attempt to revive its oil industry after years of fighting. </p> <p>After nearly three years of significant disruptions  Libya&apos;s oil production in recent months has recovered to its highest level in two years. After reopening its oil industry to foreign investors this year for the first time since deposed leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi was killed in 2011  the country was aiming to produce 1 million barrels a day by April. </p> <p>But it has fallen short -- producing about 800 000 barrels daily -- in part because Wintershall  a unit of German chemical giant BASF AG  has stopped production while the dispute involving it  the state-owned National Oil Co. and the Presidential Council -- Libya&apos;s internationally recognized government -- remains unresolved. The Wintershall stoppage has taken some 160 000 barrels a day offline  according to the state oil company. </p> <p>Mustafa Sanallah  chairman of the National Oil Co.  or NOC  said in an emailed statement Wednesday that it had shut Wintershall&apos;s access to an oil-export terminal after accusing the German company of refusing to discuss payments that Mr. Sanallah said it owes going back to 2008. He contended that Wintershall &quot;has tried to interfere in Libyan internal politics and to take advantage of the weakness of the state&quot; by attempting to make a deal with the Presidential Council that  Mr. Sanallah argues  has no authority to strike oil agreements. </p> <p>A Wintershall spokesman confirmed that the company cut output after the NOC cut off its access to the terminal. But he said there is no dispute over money with the government or the NOC  and that Wintershall is &quot;in contact with NOC about a number of issues.&quot; </p> <p>The NOC and the Presidential Council have been locked in a struggle over control of Libya&apos;s oil industry. An exchange of letters between the two authorities shows Wintershall getting embroiled in their fight. </p> <p>Since 2008  Wintershall has dealt with the NOC. But in March  the Presidential Council announced that it would be in charge of all oil contracts  a ruling the NOC disputes. </p> <p>In a letter last month to the Presidential Council  the NOC said Wintershall was &quot;deliberately ignoring&quot; a 2010 agreement it signed with the NOC concerning payments going back to 2008. Terms of that agreement make Wintershall liable for more than $900 million in payments to the NOC  according to a person familiar with the dispute. </p> <p>Mr. Sanallah said the Presidential Council rejected his demand that the NOC remain in charge of oil contracts  and added that the Council &quot;has instead sided with Wintershall against NOC.&quot; In a letter to the NOC in March  the Presdential Council asked Mr. Sanallah &quot;not to take action&quot; against Wintershall and accused Mr. Sanallah of refusing to respond to the German company  which Mr. Sanallah denied. </p> <p>The Presidential Council and Wintershall declined to comment on the letters  which were reviewed. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Presidential Council declined to comment on the dispute with the NOC and the NOC&apos;s dispute with Wintershall. </p> <p>The friction between government factions and Wintershall underscores how unstable Libya&apos;s oil output remains  even after it more than quadrupled its production from 190 000 barrels a day last summer after an agreement between rival militias that control different parts of the country. Frequent fighting constantly threatens further shutdowns. </p> <p>The country&apos;s fluctuating production has international implications. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has been working with non-OPEC countries to scale back oil production to raise crude prices. Libya&apos;s fluctuations has made it difficult for them to figure out how much to cut. And more Libyan oil entering international markets if new agreements or reached could undermine supply cuts from OPEC and its partners. </p> <p></p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 10  2017 14:37 ET (18:37 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc><db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000007050 md5=6c57c6dc4ddf4f5631a5c06de673055d sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170511 product=DN seq=2444 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=DB accession-number=0511002444 page-citation=A4 display-date=20170511T063244.546Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > From New on the Job To Spotlight&apos;s Glare -- </headline> <text> <pre> </pre> <p>The relationship between James Comey and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein got off to a seemingly normal start. </p> <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation director met his new boss fresh on the job that Mr. Rosenstein started on April 27  to tell him about the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. &quot;His first day in office I briefed him on where we are &quot; Mr. Comey told lawmakers last week. </p> <p>They met on May 1  each with their own staff member  to discuss a range of department business  according to agency officials. </p> <p>But the next week  on May 7  Mr. Rosenstein was in President Donald Trump&apos;s office with Attorney General Jeff Sessions  saying he had concerns about Mr. Comey&apos;s leadership at the FBI. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Rosenstein to put his concerns and recommendations in writing. </p> <p>The next day  Mr. Rosenstein penned a memo saying he didn&apos;t understand Mr. Comey&apos;s &quot;refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken&quot; in how he handled the investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton&apos;s email use. </p> <p>He didn&apos;t specifically recommend Mr. Comey be fired  but said: &quot;The FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.&quot; </p> <p>He added that &quot;having refused to admit his errors  the director cannot be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions.&quot; </p> <p>The memo  and the firing by Mr. Trump that followed  thrust Washington into chaos. The White House said Mr. Trump had considered replacing Mr. Comey for some time  but made a final decision on Tuesday. </p> <p>The move has cast a harsh spotlight on Mr. Rosenstein  who is less than two weeks into a job that he reached with bipartisan Senate support. During the confirmation process  he declined to commit to appointing a special prosecutor to oversee the investigation into Russia&apos;s election interference and any coordination with the Trump campaign. (Russia has denied interfering in the election  and Mr. Trump and his staff have dismissed allegations of collusion.) But Mr. Rosenstein still won the support of most Democrats with the Senate confirming him 94-6. </p> <p>He is in charge of the Russia probe because Mr. Sessions  who as attorney general would normally make any final calls on such highly sensitive cases  recused himself from any matters related to the 2016 presidential race  after his role as a supporter and adviser for Mr. Trump&apos;s campaign. </p> <p>Democrats say Mr. Rosenstein now must remove himself from the probe. &quot;Serious doubt has been cast on Mr. Rosenstein&apos;s impartiality &quot; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D.  N.Y.)  said on the Senate floor on Wednesday  calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor for the Russia investigation. &quot;Mr. Rosenstein cannot be the person to appoint that person &quot; Mr. Schumer said. </p> <p>In Wednesday&apos;s press briefing  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president had seen an &quot;erosion of confidence&quot; in Mr. Comey  citing the former director&apos;s &quot;missteps and mistakes&quot; in recent months. &quot;He had been considering letting Comey go pretty much since the day he took office &quot; she said. </p> <p>Mr. Rosenstein served as the U.S. attorney in Maryland in President George W. Bush&apos;s administration  and he stayed in the job through President Barack Obama&apos;s two terms in office. </p> <p>Colleagues have described both Mr. Comey and Mr. Rosenstein in similar terms. Both served as U.S. attorneys and focused some of their tenures on violent crime. Both are Republicans who were appointed to senior government posts by Democrats. And they had reputations for independence. Both even spearheaded separate projects named Exile to reduce gun violence. </p> <p>Mr. Rosenstein&apos;s acquaintances were absorbing the news of Mr. Comey&apos;s firing on Wednesday and reconciling it with the deputy attorney general&apos;s reputation for steering clear of politics. </p> <p>&quot;No one questioned his integrity -- ever &quot; said Robert Ehrlich  who was the Republican governor of Maryland for part of Mr. Rosenstein&apos;s tenure as U.S. attorney. </p> <p>Mr. Ehrlich  now a senior counsel at King &amp; Spalding  said he planned to call the deputy attorney general to offer support. &quot;Welcome to politics  &quot; he said. </p> <p>Gregg Bernstein  former Baltimore state&apos;s attorney  worked with Mr. Rosenstein and said the timing of Mr. Comey&apos;s firing raised questions. But he said he expected Mr. Rosenstein&apos;s role would become clearer once a successor to Mr. Comey is installed and the Russian investigation advances. </p> <p>&quot;This is a person who has had universal respect and admiration from colleagues and the public throughout his career &quot; said Mr. Bernstein  a partner at Zuckerman Spaeder LLP. </p> <p>&quot;I just don&apos;t think you throw all that away and ignore it based on his actions in his first week on the job &quot; Mr. Bernstein said. </p> <pre>  </pre> <p>  (END) </p> <p>   May 11  2017 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000006374 md5=5b47f9d0c5669b1384ef0e0a437a3812 sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170511 product=DN seq=10985 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=DB accession-number=0511010985 page-citation= display-date=20170511T191920.557Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > London and Berlin Weigh Emmanuel Macron&apos;s Impact on Brexit Talks</headline> <text> <pre> </pre> <p>In London these days  most developments in Europe are seen through the prism of Brexit. The result of the French presidential election has therefore boiled down to this: Will Emmanuel Macron be good or bad for the U.K. in its imminent negotiations over leaving the European Union? </p> <p>The first response from Paris to London is likely to be &apos;This isn&apos;t about you.&apos; The president-elect has other fish to fry. He must first work to build a majority in the National Assembly in next month&apos;s elections. Then his first international priority will likely be to rebuild France&apos;s relationship with Germany. </p> <p>On the face of it  Mr. Macron will be a hard-liner over the negotiations. During his campaign  he described himself as a &quot;hard Brexiter.&quot; Calling Brexit a crime at one point  he said Britain couldn&apos;t enjoy EU rights as a nonmember or the EU would fall apart. </p> <p>Despite this  there was relief in London that Mr. Macron won. Prime Minister Theresa May warmly congratulated him  describing France as &quot;one of our closest allies.&quot; </p> <p>That wasn&apos;t just politeness. The real worry in Whitehall was a victory for the fiercely anti-EU Marine Le Pen that would have pitched the bloc into so much turmoil that constructive divorce negotiations would have become nigh impossible. </p> <p>But is Mr. Macron just -- as Maurice Chevalier once said about old age -- better than the alternative? </p> <p>After Mr. Macron&apos;s victory on Sunday  his chief economic adviser  Jean Pisani-Ferry  said the U.K. and France had &quot;a mutual interest in keeping prosperity&quot; and maintaining their very important security and defense relationship. </p> <p>But he said that while Mr. Macron had no wish to punish Britain  the president-elect believed &quot;even today that Europe is part of the solution to the problems we are facing. He&apos;s not the sort of man who would implicitly agree to a dismemberment of the EU.&quot; </p> <p>This suggests Mr. Macron won&apos;t want to create incentives to leave the bloc and therefore won&apos;t veer from the standard EU line that the U.K. can&apos;t have a more advantageous relationship with the EU outside the bloc than it does inside. </p> <p>Politics at home in France suggests an even tougher attitude. With the traditional political parties there in disarray  the main opposition over Mr. Macron&apos;s five-year term is likely to come from Ms. Le Pen&apos;s ranks. His incentive in the negotiations may thus be to play up difficulties to demonstrate that leaving the bloc is a very bad idea. </p> <p>In an interview this week with the BBC  Mr. Pisani-Ferry also said France and the U.K. had &quot;divergent interests in some aspects of the negotiations.&quot; In an email exchange afterward  Mr. Pisani-Ferry declined to be drawn on what those &quot;divergent interests&quot; were. </p> <p>&quot;We understand that London is very focused on the Brexit negotiations but although we fully recognize the significance of the matter  we have many other urgent issues to deal with &quot; he said. </p> <p>One obvious area of divergence stands out: financial services. German officials  while conceding they know little directly of Mr. Macron&apos;s intentions  believe he is likely to adopt the departing French government&apos;s hard line on Brexit  particularly on limiting the ability of Britain&apos;s financial-services industry to do business with EU and eurozone clients. </p> <p>Several Berlin officials said this week that Paris was eager to encourage City of London businesses to move operations and jobs to the continent. Berlin  however  is skeptical that Paris  Frankfurt or Luxembourg can match the competence and critical mass of the City. By restricting the access of EU companies to the City  they fear  the 27 remaining member states could end up raising the cost of doing business in Europe. </p> <p>This concern is consistent with Germany&apos;s wish to strike a balance between softening the economic and trade impact of Brexit and deterring any country tempted to follow the U.K.&apos;s example. </p> <p>But the chief Brexit concern for German officials now is hardly Mr. Macron  but Mrs. May. They worry she might be underestimating the technical and legal complexity of separating Britain from the EU  which they think could prove a bigger obstacle to an orderly Brexit than the political differences. In the German view  London should be worried less about Paris and more about clarifying what it needs to do at home. </p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 11  2017 15:19 ET (19:19 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000005866 md5=f81801ad611b251ab8c89c3ade667d90 sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170512 product=DN seq=9141 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=DB accession-number=0512009141 page-citation= display-date=20170512T141028.484Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim Seeks Security Promises From U.S.</headline> <text> <pre> </pre> <p>LONDON--Turkey&apos;s prime minister said Friday that his nation is looking for more promises from President Donald Trump to ensure Turkey&apos;s national security  as the two allies meet next week to discuss their alliance in fighting terror in the Mideast. </p> <p>The visit by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the White House on May 16 is designed to reset relations that have soured in the last couple of years  in part due to different strategic goals in Syria and disagreements over domestic Turkish politics. </p> <p>Mr. Trump was the first Western leader to congratulate Mr. Erdogan on last month&apos;s controversial referendum giving him more power  while other Western allies have been more circumspect  citing concern about what they view as a weakening of democratic institutions and a widening crackdown against Mr. Erdogan&apos;s political foes. </p> <p>Turkey&apos;s government hopes past disagreements can be put behind them and the strategic partners can strengthen their ties  both economically and on national security  Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters during a visit to London. </p> <p>Turkey  a fellow member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  hosts nearly 5 000 U.S. servicemen at its Incirlik Air Base  which the U.S. uses as the base for a significant amount of operations against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. </p> <p>&quot;We want sincerity with the U.S. &quot; Mr. Yildirim said. &quot;We believe they [the White House] are sincere in mending relations with Turkey.&quot; </p> <p>Both Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Yildirim in different press conferences on Friday sought to play down the announcement earlier this week by the Trump administration that the U.S. would arm a Syrian Kurdish militia that Turkey and others view as a branch of the Kurdistan Workers&apos; Party  or PKK. Both Turkey and the U.S. have designated the group a terror organization because of its bloody decadeslong insurgency for autonomy against Turkey. </p> <p>The Syrian fighters  called the YPG  will be the vanguard force in the operation to retake Raqqa  the Islamic State&apos;s capital in Syria and one of its last urban footholds in that country. </p> <p> In London  where he was attending a donors&apos; conference on Somalia  Mr. Yildirim struck a note of pragmatism and conciliation on the YPG issue. He said U.S. officials have explained the need to arm the YPG was one of &quot;necessity &quot; not choice  due to the urgency among U.S. military planners to start the campaign for Raqqa and destroy Islamic State. </p> <p>Turkey believes that the tactical move will result in more instability in Syria  as it believes the YPG&apos;s goal of Kurdish autonomy will undermine the territorial integrity of its Mideast neighbor. Turkey also fears that a strengthened YPG will create blowback in Turkey&apos;s fight against the PKK at home. </p> <p>&quot;We believe the U.S. is making a mistake and this mistake will be seen sooner or later and felt by Turkey. The cost of those mistakes are paid by people in the region &quot; Mr. Yildirim said. </p> <p>The prime minister said that U.S. officials are working to smooth over the disagreement by deepening intelligence-sharing with Turkey in its fight against PKK. </p> <p>The  reported earlier in the week that the U.S. was discussing how to boost intelligence-sharing with Turkey as it fights PKK positions in Iraq. </p> <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  who met with the Turkish prime minister in London on Thursday  said the U.S. would look into boosting efforts to identify and sanction the PKK&apos;s global financial networks  Mr. Yildirim said. </p> <p>U.S. officials were not immediately available to comment. The U.S. Treasury has several times in the recent past sanctioned individuals it identified as PKK financiers. </p> <p>The defense secretary also repeated U.S. promises that the its military will not allow YPG arms to be used against Turkish targets  Mr. Yildirim said. </p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>  May 12  2017 10:10 ET (14:10 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000008321 md5=1c0d5dffa3cc85a144ca3df356740707 sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170513 product=DN seq=723 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=BA accession-number=0513000723 page-citation=38 display-date=20170513T100052.440Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Editorial Commentary: The Real American Weakness</headline> <text> <p>   Both the president and the former FBI director have acted inappropriately </p> <pre> </pre> <p>Had enough? President Donald Trump had enough of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey last week  for reasons that seemed good enough. But the president had spent the past year praising Comey whenever the director&apos;s actions suited Trump&apos;s political needs and condemning him when he did not deliver what the president wanted. Americans should say they&apos;ve had enough of that. </p> <p>Trump has gone back and forth on Comey like a tennis ball in a hard-fought match  showing as much self-control and responsibility as the ball. </p> <p>As with other memorable Washington crises  from Richard Nixon&apos;s Watergate to the Internal Revenue Service&apos;s targeting of right-wing groups seeking tax-exempt status during the Obama administration  investigations become ends as well as means. Just as a cover-up can become more important than the offense being covered up  so the preservation and extension of an investigation can become more important than whatever is being investigated. </p> <p>By his overly public and erratic behavior  Comey helped conflate the FBI&apos;s investigation of Hillary Clinton&apos;s emails  its concurrent probe of the ways that the Russian government attempted to interfere with the 2016 presidential election  and the strange Russophilia of Trump&apos;s short-term national security advisor  Michael Flynn. </p> <p>Enough Is Too Much </p> <p>Comey&apos;s FBI has been up to its elbows in presidential politics since 2015  when the bureau let it be known it had opened a criminal probe of classified emails on Hillary Clinton&apos;s home computer server -- compounding her inappropriate privatizing of her communications as secretary of state with his inappropriate leak of information about the investigation. </p> <p>Then the FBI started looking at contacts between the Russian government and members of the Trump campaign -- generating inappropriate assumptions about connections to the Clinton emails. </p> <p>Comey stained himself in July 2016 when he held a press conference to announce all the ways that Clinton had been &quot;extremely careless&quot; about handling classified material  including the possibility that hackers had gained access. He didn&apos;t say that the hackers were definitely Russian or that they were definitely successful  but Russian hackers did gain access to the Democratic National Committee&apos;s computer system. </p> <p>After his recitation of Clinton&apos;s errors  Comey declared that Clinton should not be prosecuted -- inappropriately on at least two levels  since it&apos;s the job of a prosecutor and a grand jury to make such decisions  not the investigating agency  and because neither the investigators nor the prosecutors are supposed to discuss such decisions in public. </p> <p>Trump weighed in inappropriately several times  cheering on Russian hackers in general and urging the Russian government to publish anything it found. Of course  he condemned Comey&apos;s decision not to prosecute Clinton: &quot;Today is the best evidence ever that we&apos;ve seen that our system is absolutely  totally rigged.&quot; Later  he accused the Obama administration of tapping communications in Trump Tower in New York  an accusation still unencumbered by evidence. </p> <p>In October  just before the election  the FBI learned that thousands of emails sent and received by one of Clinton&apos;s closest aides had been backed up on her husband&apos;s computer  including some to and from Clinton. </p> <p>Comey decided that he would have to reopen the investigation of Clinton and alerted congressional leaders in a letter that was immediately leaked. Trump cheered the decision: &quot;What he did  he brought back his reputation...What he did was the right thing.&quot; </p> <p>Two days before the election  Comey sent another letter to Congress reporting that there was nothing new in the emails on the Clinton aide&apos;s husband&apos;s computer  and thus Comey again lost Trump&apos;s confidence. </p> <p>Trump won the presidential election with very small margins in several swing states. It was clear to Clinton and many others that the FBI chief&apos;s inappropriate actions had hurt her cause. </p> <p>In March of this year  Comey gave open testimony to the House intelligence committee confirming the FBI was investigating inappropriate connections between the Trump administration and the Russian government -- an inappropriate revelation for the director of a counterintelligence agency. </p> <p>Comey also testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 2  when Trump tweeted  &quot;FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?&quot; </p> <p>Trump apparently decided last weekend to rid himself of Comey  who was  by many accounts  deeply involved in supervising the Russia probe. The  and others have reported that investigators are working on intelligence reports suggesting that Trump or his associates have business dealings or investments that are tied to the Russian government. So far  this theory has not been supported by public evidence. </p> <p>Memos for the Files </p> <p>Trump asked the attorney general and the deputy attorney general to supply letters outlining the defects in Comey&apos;s handling of the Clinton matter. Under that cover  the president then said that he accepted their recommendation that Comey be fired. (Trump also has told other stories about the dismissal.) </p> <p>By his own actions  words  and tweets  the president has come under suspicion of putting his interests ahead of America&apos;s. To make this mess useful  the nation&apos;s chief executive should disclose all his business and financial relationships  including his tax returns and other records  and all the investigations should be managed outside the FBI and the Justice Department by a relentless  nonpartisan independent counsel appointed by Congress. </p> <p>Trump often says that the people don&apos;t care about his tax returns  and his supporters do seem blissfully uninterested in the details of his rise and his wealth. </p> <p>But public officials have a more exacting responsibility. What matters most is whether the president has profited  politically or corporately  from an inappropriate connection to a foreign government. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 13  2017 06:00 ET (10:00 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000004779 md5=dfedc9ddae1a71ca168b07ed681cb82e sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170514 product=DN seq=405 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=DB accession-number=0514000405 page-citation= display-date=20170514T102013.388Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Emmanuel Macron Is Inaugurated as French President -- 2nd Update</headline> <text> <pre> By Matthew Dalton </pre> <p>PARIS-- Emmanuel Macron was sworn in as the president of France on Sunday  launching the 39-year-old&apos;s efforts to overhaul the French economy and reinforce the European Union. </p> <p>At the start of a ceremony at the & <p>In his first speech shortly after  Mr. Macron said France under his presidency would act as a bulwark for the international community. </p> <p>&quot;The world and Europe today more than ever need France &quot; he said. &quot;They need a France strong and sure of its destiny.&quot; </p> <p>After 45 minutes  Mr. Macron escorted Mr. Hollande to a waiting car  which drove him from the palace. Then Mr. Macron proceeded to a ceremony on the other side of the palace  where the results of last week&apos;s election were read out and Mr. Macron officially became president. </p> <p>Sunday&apos;s ceremony caps a remarkable rise for Mr. Macron that is remaking France&apos;s political order. Working as an investment banker just five years ago  he swept into office by sidestepping France&apos;s mainstream political parties  which for decades have groomed France&apos;s leaders. </p> <p>Instead  Mr. Macron decided to form his own party  En Marche  or On the Move  13 months ago. Now the party is fielding hundreds of candidates in France&apos;s upcoming legislative elections  half of whom are newcomers to politics and owe their political fortunes to Mr. Macron. </p> <p>Mr. Macron a week ago won the presidential election in a landslide against Marine Le Pen  a far-right nationalist who sought to pull France from the EU and close the country&apos;s borders. He ran as a staunch defender of the bloc and a business-friendly centrist who would shake up France&apos;s tightly regulated economy. </p> <p>Mr. Macron&apos;s first order of business will be tending to France&apos;s relationship with Germany  the country&apos;s most important ally. Mr. Macron is scheduled to fly to Berlin on Monday to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </p> <p>Under high security in a city repeatedly hit by terror attacks in recent years  Mr. Macron&apos;s car left his apartment Sunday morning in the 7th arrondissement of Paris  headed across the Seine river  and arrived at the & <p>France remains in a state of emergency  declared shortly after the terror attacks of November 2015.

A poll of more than 2 000 adults published Monday by ICM put support for the Conservatives at 35% against 24% for Labour  with the remainder either undecided or planning to vote for smaller parties or abstain. </p> <p>Mrs. May has sought to woo working-class voters who for years made up the backbone of Labour&apos;s support. She has been aided by strong support for Brexit among many of them  a decline in Labour in Scotland  and the unpopularity of Mr. Corbyn himself. </p> <p>Labour said in its manifesto that it will seek a close relationship with the European Union after Brexit that maintains many of the benefits of the EU&apos;s single market for goods and services  though it didn&apos;t elaborate on how this would be achieved. Mrs. May advocates a clear break  and says she wants to strike a far-reaching free-trade deal with the EU instead. </p> <p>In a separate document  Labour said its commitments amount to around GBP50 billion ($64.5 billion) in additional public spending over the next five years  which it said would be financed entirely by new taxes. Economy spokesman John McDonnell said Labour would  though  take advantage of record-low interest rates to finance greater investment in infrastructure. </p> <p>In response  Conservative David Gauke  chief secretary to the Treasury  said Labour&apos;s sums &quot;don&apos;t add up&quot; and taxes would have to rise more broadly to finance the extra spending. </p> <p> </p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 16  2017 13:06 ET (17:06 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000005514 md5=025c81f7907a88e9065bdcdf86b2cfd1 sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170516 product=DN seq=6860 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=T accession-number=0516006860 page-citation= display-date=20170516T194135.333Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Brexit &amp; Beyond: Labour&apos;s Left-Wing Platform  U.K. Inflation Rises  EU Court Limits Trade Pact Powers</headline> <text> <pre>    </pre> <p> </p> <p>   Brexit &amp; Beyond: Europe in Flux is The &apos;s round-up of news and analysis of how Brexit will affect global business  economies and finance.

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said he was considering subpoenaing the memo  if it wasn&apos;t made available. Mr. Chaffetz on Tuesday night requested the FBI provide by May 24 all memos  notes  summaries and recordings of communication between Mr. Trump and Mr. Comey in a letter to FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe. The move was supported by House Speaker Paul Ryan. </p> <p>   &quot;We need to have all the facts  and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo &quot; AshLee Strong  a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan  said in a statement. </p> <p>   Mr. Chaffetz insisted the House could get its business done despite the upheaval. </p> <p>   &quot;The government is always full of crisis -- some of this is very self-inflicted by the White House itself -- but we still have to be able to pass meaningful legislation and get it to the president&apos;s desk &quot; Mr. Chaffetz told NBC Tuesday night. </p> <p>   Other congressional Republicans called on Mr. Comey to deliver a full explanation. </p> <p>   The series of controversies involving the president has threatened to swamp his legislative agenda on Capitol Hill  with potential hearings and widening investigations siphoning time and energy from plans to overhaul the health-care system and tax code. </p> <pre>    </pre> <p>   The United Nations Security Council on Tuesday held a closed-door  emergency meeting on North Korea  holding talks on new sanctions in response to the country&apos;s latest ballistic missile test. </p> <p>   The U.S. and China were negotiating a resolution that would implement new sanctions and tighten existing penalties on Pyongyang  diplomats said.

Trey Gowdy  of South Carolina  said he didn&apos;t want to be considered because he wasn&apos;t the right person for the job. Mr. Gowdy stressed that the FBI and the nation needed someone who could &quot;unite the country.&quot; </p> <p>A former federal prosecutor  Mr. Gowdy headed a House probe into the 2012 terror attacks on a U.S. compound in Benghazi  Libya  an inquiry that sharply divided Republicans and Democrats. </p> <p>Their decisions underscored the difficulty a Republican officeholder might face in winning confirmation in the aftermath of President Donald Trump&apos;s abrupt firing of Director James Comey. Republicans as well as Democrats have urged Mr. Trump to name someone from outside politics  and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R.  Ky.) told Bloomberg News Tuesday Mr. Trump should choose an &quot;apolitical&quot; director. </p> <p>The push to find a new director of the FBI was eclipsed somewhat Tuesday by reports that Mr. Trump had disclosed sensitive material to Russian officials  but the White House continues to say it hopes to move quickly to fill the post. </p> <p>The FBI director post has generally gone to a former top federal prosecutor or senior law-enforcement official  not a political figure  and the current vacancy may be especially sensitive because Mr. Comey was spearheading the FBI investigation into whether Mr. Trump&apos;s campaign or associates colluded with the Russian government in meddling in the 2016 election. </p> <p>Russia and Mr. Trump have denied any wrongdoing. </p> <p>Mr. Cornyn&apos;s announcement came as associates of a dark-horse candidate  U.S. Circuit Judge Merrick Garland  said he wasn&apos;t interested in the job. Judge Garland was tapped last year by then-President Barack Obama to be a justice on the Supreme Court  only to see his nomination stymied by Senate Republicans  who held the seat open for Mr. Trump&apos;s eventual appointee  now-Justice Neil Gorsuch. </p> <p>Utah Sen. Mike Lee and other Republicans  including Mr. McConnell  had suggested Judge Garland would be a good choice because he wasn&apos;t seen as partisan and would win confirmation. </p> <p>But Democrats have signaled they didn&apos;t want to lose Judge Garland on the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Judge Garland wasn&apos;t among at least eight people interviewed on Saturday at the Justice Department by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. </p> <p>The remaining known candidates all fit the mold of recent directors who have had federal law-enforcement experience. Among them is Mike Rogers  a former Republican congressman who also served as an FBI agent and who has won the recent backing of an association that represents current and retired FBI agents. Others are Michael Garcia  a New York state judge and former U.S. attorney; Alice Fisher  a Justice Department official in the Bush administration; and two top FBI officials  including current Acting Director Andrew McCabe. </p> <p>Justice Department officials cautioned that Mr. Sessions  Mr. Rosenstein and White House staffers were still assessing candidates and no final decision had been made on whom to recommend to Mr. Trump. </p> <p>The president has said he hopes to quickly tap someone to run the bureau  which has 13 000 agents and 35 000 employees and investigates crimes ranging from bank robbery to terrorism. </p> <p></p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 17  2017 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000004589 md5=3f6f39c09ceb0ef22fb2c66b8b66982a sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170517 product=DN seq=989 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=DB accession-number=0517000989 page-citation=A10 display-date=20170517T063223.970Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Pre-Poll Labour Manifesto Tacks Left -- </headline> <text> <pre>  </pre> <p>LONDON -- The U.K.&apos;s main opposition Labour Party on Tuesday pledged to nationalize parts of British industry and raise taxes on high earners if it wins a national election June 8   an avowedly left-wing platform that party leader Jeremy Corbyn hopes will narrow a gap in the polls with Prime Minister Theresa May&apos;s governing Conservatives. </p> <p> Launching the party&apos;s election manifesto at an event in northern England  Mr. Corbyn said that for the past seven years the U.K. has been run &quot;for the rich  the elite and the vested interest &quot; vowing to fashion an economy &quot;run for the many  not the few&quot; if he wins power. </p> <p>In a throwback to the politics of the early 1980s in Britain  the manifesto listed commitments to nationalize railways and water companies and to increase taxes on corporations and the top 5% of earners. </p> <p>The 128-page document also promised to raise the minimum wage and to create a National Investment Bank with regional branches to finance small-business lending  policies the party hopes will strike a chord with voters wearied by years of sluggish earnings growth and a long squeeze on public spending. </p> <p>Mr. Corbyn&apos;s pitch highlights how far left the Labour Party has tacked since former Prime Minister Tony Blair stood down as leader in 2007 following three back-to-back election victories under the centrist &quot;New Labour&quot; banner. </p> <p>Opinion polls suggest Mrs. May and the center-right Conservatives are heading for a big win in next month&apos;s vote. A poll of more than 2 000 adults published Monday by ICM put support for the Conservatives at 35% against 24% for Labour  with the remainder either undecided or planning to vote for smaller parties or abstain. </p> <p>Mrs. May has sought to woo working-class voters who for years made up the backbone of Labour&apos;s support. She has been aided by strong support for Brexit among many of them  a decline in Labour in Scotland  and the unpopularity of Mr. Corbyn himself. </p> <p>Labour said in its manifesto that it will seek a close relationship with the European Union after Brexit that maintains many of the benefits of the EU&apos;s single market for goods and services  though it didn&apos;t elaborate on how this would be achieved. Mrs. May advocates a clear break  and says she wants to strike a far-reaching free-trade deal with the EU instead. </p> <p>In a separate document  Labour said its commitments amount to around GBP50 billion ($64.5 billion) in additional public spending over the next five years  which it said would be financed entirely by new taxes. Economy spokesman John McDonnell said Labour would  though  take advantage of record-low interest rates to finance greater investment in infrastructure. </p> <p>In response  Conservative David Gauke  chief secretary to the Treasury  said Labour&apos;s sums &quot;don&apos;t add up&quot; and taxes would have to rise more broadly to finance the extra spending. </p> <p> </p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 17  2017 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000012460 md5=0a56caa63de832f1dd1a459ffc090cf4 sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170518 product=DN seq=3985 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=T accession-number=0518003985 page-citation= display-date=20170518T120145.915Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Capital Journal Daybreak: The Russia Probe  More</headline> <text> <pre>    </pre> <p>   HIGHLIGHTS </p> <pre>    -- Ex-FBI Chief Robert Mueller III to Lead Russia Probe   -- Republicans Back More Active Role in Trump Probes   -- Israeli Source Seen Key to Countering ISIS   -- Trump Meets With Candidates to Lead FBI   -- Russian State-Run Bank Financed Deal Involving Trump Hotel Partner </pre> <p>   RUSSIA PROBE GETS SPECIAL COUNSEL: Former FBI Director Robert Mueller III was appointed Wednesday as special counsel to oversee the federal investigation into Russia&apos;s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election  giving him wide latitude to explore potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a statement he was naming a special counsel due to the inquiry&apos;s &quot;unique circumstances.&quot; The public interest  he said  &quot;requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.&quot; Mr. Rosenstein cautioned that his decision wasn&apos;t the result of a &quot;finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted.&quot; He said he has made no such determination.

Under federal regulations from 1999  the attorney general may appoint a temporary special counsel from outside the Justice Department to conduct a criminal probe into a particularly sensitive matter and to potentially prosecute related wrongdoing. While the special counsel isn&apos;t subject to day-to-day supervision  Mr. Mueller can be asked to report to the attorney general -- or in this case  the deputy attorney general  because the attorney general has recused himself -- about &quot;any investigative or prosecutorial step.&quot; Here&apos;s more about the role . </p> <p>   Read the  Justice Department order appointing Mr. Mueller  and check here to see updates throughout the day ...

At least three congressional panels -- the House Oversight Committee  the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee -- all demanded memos that fomer FBI Director James Comey kept about his conversations with the president. The Judiciary Committee also sought any tapes of the conversation that might exist  and two panels requested Mr. Comey&apos;s in-person testimony. Congress&apos;s more proactive approach is being sanctioned by Republican leaders in both the House and Senate  as lawmakers seek Mr. Comey&apos;s version of a private meeting he had with Mr. Trump in February when the GOP president allegedly urged him to drop his probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Roger Stone  a Republican operative who was closely involved with Mr. Trump&apos;s campaign  responded to a photograph of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud placing a medal around the president&apos;s neck by writing on Twitter: &quot;Candidly  this makes me want to puke.&quot; </p> <p>Mr. Trump avoided sensitive issues of human rights  repressive regimes and official support for Muslim clerics in the region who inspire some militant extremists. The absence of a human-rights discussion drew quick criticism from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. </p> <p>&quot;I think this is a broader element of the administration&apos;s policy  that they&apos;re going to de-emphasize issues of human rights -- that what countries do within their own boundaries  we&apos;re essentially going to look the other way &quot; said Rep. Adam Schiff (D.  Calif.). </p> <p>Sen. Marco Rubio  said on CNN &quot;State of the Union&quot; on Sunday that his own approach is to be &quot;much more forceful and open and vocal about criticizing whether it&apos;s Egypt or Saudi Arabia for its human-rights record.&quot; </p> <p>Saudi Arabia has helped roll back meager democratic gains made in many countries after the 2011 Arab Spring by throwing its weight behind Egypt&apos;s military and undermining political Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood. It maintains tight control over its domestic politics  limiting the rights of Saudi women and minorities. </p> <p>In Bahrain  Mr. Trump told King Sheikh Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa there would be no more &quot;strain&quot; in the relationship between the two allies. </p> <p>&quot;Sounds like a green light for violations &quot; tweeted prominent Bahraini human rights activist Maryam Alkhawaja  reacting to the news. Bahrain has cracked down on dissenters since 2011  violently putting down popular protests. </p> <p>Still  many Saudis celebrated Mr. Trump&apos;s visit  reveling in the spotlight the U.S. president and his family have brought to the country. Social media noted the presence of his daughter and senior White House adviser Ivanka Trump. The World Bank announced at a Sunday event with Ms. Trump that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have pledged a total of $100 million to a new fund assisting female entrepreneurs. </p> <p>&quot;Trump&apos;s Daughter&quot; was the top trending hashtag on Twitter for most of Saturday  riffing off previous social media phenomena where Mr. Trump was referred to as Abu Ivanka -- meaning &quot;Ivanka&apos;s Father&quot; in Arabic. </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <pre>  </pre> <p>   (END) </p> <p>   May 22  2017 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)</p> </text> </body> </db> </doc> <db_xml> <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM db-1.0b.dtd> <doc msize=000010552 md5=f5e2aa029b00316fc7bf7bb4e1fdaa69 sysId=sbknwsarchp01 destination=AW distId=     transmission-date=> <db publisher=DBN docdate=20170523 product=DN seq=3782 xml:lang=en-us > <head> <copyright year=2017 holder= &amp; Company, Inc. ></copyright> <docdata> <db> <db-newswires news-source=DB origin=DB service-id=CO > <db-press-cutout/> <db-urgency>0</db-urgency> <db-mdata brand=DB temp-perm=P retention=N hot=N original-source=FW accession-number=0523003782 page-citation= display-date=20170523T125010.921Z >  <body> <headline brand-display=DB > Market Talk Roundup: Latest on Trump  U.S. Politics</headline> <text> <p>   0850 ET - AT&amp;T (T) CEO Randall Stephenson says he&apos;s &quot;still optimistic&quot; Congress can quickly overhaul corporate taxes  citing generally bipartisan consensus.
